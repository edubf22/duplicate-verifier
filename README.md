# duplicate-verifier (in progress)
NLP miniproject where I try to identify duplicate Quora questions. This was done as part of the Lighthouse Labs Data Science bootcamp, where we had one day to tackle this problem. 

# Objective
Build a model capable of identifying questions that are duplicates of each other. 

# Methods
All work was conducted in a Jupyter Notebook using Python. Data was processed using Pandas and NumPy, and visualizations were created using matplotlib and WordCloud. 

For modelling, different approaches were taken. Both bag of words and TF-IDF were used, and different algorithms were tested with each method (Logistic Regression, XGBoost Classifier and Tensorflow Neural Networks).
