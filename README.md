# duplicate-verifier (in progress)
NLP miniproject where I try to identify duplicate Quora questions. This was done as part of the Lighthouse Labs Data Science bootcamp, where we had one day to tackle this problem. 

# Objective
Build a model capable of identifying questions that are duplicates of each other.
